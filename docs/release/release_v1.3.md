# MagellanMapper v1.3 Release Notes

## MagellanMapper v1.3.8

This is a bugfix release for MagellanMapper.

### Changes

Installation
- Fixed missing dependencies required by Pyface Conda dependency

GUI
- Fixed incorrect color mapping for some corresponding labels (ie same region in opposite hemispheres)

Atlas refinement
- Fixed error in compactness measurement when no surface is found

Atlas registration
- Specify a full fallback atlas profile rather than only a fallback similarity metric if the post-registration DSC falls below threshold (`metric_sim_fallback` setting)

Cell detection
- Fixed applying the first channel's profile setting for image saturation to all channels during blob detection

I/O
- Fixed reading image size and resolution metadata when values for some dimensions are missing
- Fixed importing RGB images
- Fixed redundant channel import for some formats (eg some OME-TIFF files)

### Dependency Updates

- Added `import_metadata` and `import_resources` packages required by Pyface


## MagellanMapper v1.3.7

This is a bugfix release for MagellanMapper.

### Changes

Installation
- Fixed launch error when Javabridge is installed but Java is not

GUI
- The "Save Figure" button opens a file save dialog to configure the location, filename, and file format of saved figures

- Fixed Atlas Editor to enable saving after edge interpolation

CLI
- Configure DPI of saved images using `--plot_labels dpi=<n>`
- Specify colors for NaN values through `--plot_labels nan_color=<color>` instead of through `--atlas_labels binary=<color>`, which is now only specifies colors when displaying labels as binary images to fix this display
- Defaults to saving images in PNG format, even if `--savefig <ext>` is not set
- CLI sub-arguments are now shown in `./run.py -h` (help documentation)
- Fixed saved plane filenames to use the plane index for the axis corresponding to the saved plane

Python stats and plots
- Excludes decimal points that were likely included by floating-point errors
- Fixed mapping measurements to labels with weighting


## MagellanMapper v1.3.6

## MagellanMapper v1.3.0

This release brings many changes to streamline both the graphical and command-line interfaces. Please note that several options have changed, which may require updating custom scripts. The sample commands script (`bin/sample_cmds.sh`) has been updated to illustrate this usage.

Summary of usage changes:

| Old | New | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python -m magmap.xx.yy` | `run_cli.py` | All command-line based entry points can be accessed through the CLI using this script |
| Use atlas profile for registration | No longer needed | Atlases should be fully imported before image registration, and the atlas's profile should no longer be typically given when registering an image |
| `--stats` | `--df` | Run data-frame (eg CSV file) tasks |
| `--roc` | `--grid_search <name1>[,name2]` | Its main task is to perform Grid Search based hyperparameter tuning; specify profile names or YAML files |
| `--rescale` | `--transform rescale=x` | Grouped with other transformation tasks |
| `--microscope <name1>[_name2]` | `--roi_profile <name1>[,name2]` | Specifies profiles to process by regions of interest; delimit by `,` to allow underscores especially in file paths |
| `--reg_profile <name1>[_name2]` | `--atlas_profile <name1>[,name2]` | Specifies profiles for atlases; delimit by `,` to allow underscores especially in file paths |
| `--saveroi` | `--save_subimg` | Consistency with "sub-images" as parts of images that can contain ROIs |
| `--chunk_size` | None | Obsolete |
| `finer` atlas profile | None | Its settings are now default |
| `--res` | `--set_meta resolutions=x,y,z` | Grouped custom metadata settings into `--set_meta` |
| `--mag` | `--set_meta magnification=x.y` | Grouped custom metadata settings into `--set_meta` |
| `--zoom` | `--set_meta zoom=x,y,z` | Grouped custom metadata settings into `--set_meta` |

| `--no_scale_bar` | `--plot_labels scale_bar=1` | Grouped with other plot labels controls |
| `--padding_2d` | `--plot_labels margin=x,y,z` | Grouped with other plot labels controls, adding `margin` as space outside the ROI |
| `--border` | `--plot_labels padding=x,y,z` | Duplicated by the `padding` argument |
| `--channel c1` | `--channel c1 [c2...]` | Accepts multiple channels (v1.3.1) |
