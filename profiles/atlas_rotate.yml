# Example profile for image rotation
# Copy this file and edit your copy for own custom registrations

rotate:
  # rotations given as `[[degrees1, axis1], [degrees2, axis2], ...]`, where
  # +deg = counter-clockwise, axis 0 = z-plane
  rotation: [[45, 1]]
  # True to expand the image size to fit the rotated original image 
  resize: True
  # spline interpolation order, where 0 = nearest-neighbor, 1 = bi-linear,
  # etc (see skimage.transform.warps)
  order: 1
