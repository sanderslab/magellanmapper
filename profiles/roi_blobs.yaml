# 3D blob detection parameters
# Copy this configuration template to a new file to customize settings.
# For more details on parameters and ranges, see:
# https://github.com/sanderslab/magellanmapper/blob/master/magmap/settings/roi_prof.py#L72-L97

# many of these settings are used in the method described here:
# https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.blob_log
min_sigma_factor: 3 # make smaller to detect smaller blobs
max_sigma_factor: 5 # make larger to detect larger blobs
num_sigma: 10 # number of intermediate values between min/max
detection_threshold: 0.1 # make smaller to detect lower intensity blobs
overlap: 0.5 # blob overlap fraction from 0-1; remove blob if above overlap

# pixels to exclude along border after blob detection to avoid clumping
# along image borders
exclude_border: null # sequence in z,y,x

# Preprocessing

# intensity contrast stretching, from 0-100
clip_vmin: 5
clip_vmax: 99.5

# intensity clipping after stretch, from 0-1
clip_min: 0.2
clip_max: 1.0

# denoising, typical default is 0.1
tot_var_denoise: null

# anisotropic resizing factor; setting any value triggers resizing to be
# isotropic, and the vals given here are multipliers in z,y,x after this
# isotropic scaling; eg (0.7, 1, 1) rescales the z-axis to be 0.7x isotropic
isotropic_vis: null
